# RBLX Compressor       
A tool for easily and quickily compressing ROBLOX places to bz2 (bzip2) for use in the old Roblox launcher [Novetus](https://bitl.itch.io/novetus)

This runs on systems with at least Windows 7, or Linux using Wine (You'll need to install .NET Framework 4.8 and Mono).
## Building
**Windows**

This project requires Visual Studio 2019 at least (It might work with older versions, I haven't tested this.), and .NET Framework 4.8 SDK to build. 
* Open "RBXCompressor.sln"
* Right click the solution and select "Restore NuGet Packages"
* Then go to "Build" and "Build Solution". The built files will be in the downloaded repository, "Build" and either "Debug" or "Release".

## Planned features
Compressing for Sodikm (which uses *.gz format)\
Batch compression (compress multiple maps at once into their own files)
